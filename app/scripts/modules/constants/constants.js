/**
 * @ngdoc module
 * @name constants
 * @description
 * Provide constants for our application. Since constants don't change, they can be injected into a module configuration,
 * so we can set our mocks as constants and inject them directly into appDev and still be able to call them in other
 * places without redefining them.
 *
 * This is also a good place to store any messaging or anything else that would normally go into a database.
